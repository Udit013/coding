        A place that I enjoy going to is the beach..
        <tt> It is seen as a place of relaxation because it is normally quiet</tt>
        <strong>and peaceful there. To look around you and see the beauty of mother nature at it's finest.</strong>
        <strike> The majority of people you ask will say that it is one of their favorite vacation
            destinations.</strike>
        <em>Not only for the beauty andrelaxation but for the sheer entertainment.</em> That is the three reasons I
        enjoy it as much as I do.To sit there under the sun feeling the warmth of it beating down on your skin.
        <blockquote>I go to the beach to get away from all my troubles that are bothering me.</blockquote>
        <cite>To feel the grainy sand
        all under your toes.
        To know that if you get too hot that you only have to walk about ten feet down until you
        get into the brisk cool ocean, and feel instant
        relief from the blistering sun.</cite>Also to lay on a float in the ocean and just feel the ocean as you are a part of it.
        Not only to feel but to hear the waves is the ultimate relaxation.
